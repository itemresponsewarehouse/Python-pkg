"""Offline coverage for describe_filter()'s categorical branch.

describe_filter() is how a Python user discovers what they can filter on, so
its output has to agree with what filter() actually matches. filter() matches
tag ATOMS (via _split_tags); describe_filter() used to count whole cells, so
for the multi-select columns it reported combinations that filter() would
never match. See issue #8.

No network: both metadata lookups are patched.
