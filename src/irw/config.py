"""Configuration constants for IRW package.

To add another main IRW Redivis warehouse, append a (user, dataset_ref) tuple to
MAIN_REFS below. All package operations (list_tables, fetch, filter, download,
info, etc.) discover tables across every entry in MAIN_REFS automatically — no
other code changes are required. Item text works the same way via ITEMTEXT_REFS.
Both are lists because Redivis caps a dataset at 1000 tables.

See docs/DEVELOPERS.md for the full contributor checklist and test commands.

# Main IRW metadata table references.
#
# Address these by BARE NAME, never by the qualified `name:refid` form. Redivis
# mints a fresh reference id for every table on every release, so a hardcoded id
# stops resolving inside the next version: v19.3 had metadata:h5gs, v21.0 has
# metadata:hb7q. The package always asks for the latest version tag, so a stale
# id yields "Not found" and every metadata-dependent call degrades -- info()
# raises, and list_tables(include_metadata=True) and filter() silently fall back
# to names only. The redivis client warns you to prefer the qualified reference;
# for these tables, do not. (The R package addresses tables by name and was
# never affected.)
